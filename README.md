# 🧠 Applied Deep Learning & Data Science Curriculum Notes

## ✨ Overview

This repository archives my comprehensive notes, practical code examples, and class materials covering a full curriculum in **Data Science, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Advanced Deep Learning Architectures**.

The content is organized chronologically and thematically, documenting the journey from foundational Python programming and data manipulation to the implementation of state-of-the-art neural networks (ANN, CNN, RNN/LSTM) and an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🗃️ Module Breakdown: The Learning Path

The materials are structured across three primary modules: Fundamentals, Core Deep Learning, and Advanced Topics.

### Module 1: 🐍 Python & Data Science Fundamentals

This initial phase establishes the essential toolset for any data professional, focusing on the basics of Python and foundational data handling libraries.

| Topic/File Name | Type | Key Learning Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-4. Python Core Concepts** | Docs/Activity | Keywords, Identifiers, Variables, Basic Input/Output, and Program Statements. |
| **5. NumPy** | Docs | Essential numerical computing, array creation, indexing, and manipulation. |
| **6. Pandas** | Docs/Excel | Data structure (DataFrame) mastery, data loading, cleaning, and preparation. |
| **7-8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Docs/Excel | Techniques for summarizing, visualizing data characteristics, and identifying patterns. **(e.g., Diabetes & Used Cars Data)**. |

### Module 2: 🧱 Core Deep Learning Architectures

This module dives into the theory and practical implementation of the main classes of Neural Networks using modern frameworks (TensorFlow/Keras).
